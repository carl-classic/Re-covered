<summary>About</summary>

**Re-covered** gives new textures to enchanted books, each with unique and intuitive look.\
Drawn in vanilla art style, using symbols representing enchantments' effects.\
The era of organized chests has arrived, and the days of endless item searching are over!\
Now you can simply judge the book... by its cover.

<summary>Future Development</summary>
  
As for now, I'm maintaining the resource pack, listening to all of the criticism and suggestions, hoping to make it even better than it already is. Every time Mojang adds a new enchantment, I will try to be there to come up with something polished. Currently I have no plans for creating mod compatibilities.

Thank you for downloading and sharing my project, it makes me very proud.\
